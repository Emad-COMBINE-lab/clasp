# CLASP: Contrastive Learning of Amino acid, Structure, and Protein description

**CLASP** is a tri-modal contrastive learning framework for unified representation of protein structure, sequence, and description. It enables downstream applications such as cross-modal retrieval, similarity scoring, and zero-shot classification by learning a shared embedding space across all three modalities.

## Overview of the CLASP framework

CLASP (Contrastive Learning of Amino acid, Structure, and Protein description) is a tri-modal contrastive learning framework designed to unify protein structure (as PDB files), amino acid sequence, and natural language description into a shared embedding space. By learning aligned representations across these biologically complementary views, CLASP supports downstream applications such as cross-modal retrieval, similarity scoring, and zero-shot classification without requiring task-specific supervision.

Each modality is first encoded independently: protein structures are converted into residue-level graphs using [Graphein](https://graphein.ai/) and embedded via an [E(3)-invariant graph neural network (EGNN)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2102.09844), amino acid sequences are embedded using pretrained language models like [ProtT5](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3095381), and textual descriptions are embedded using biomedical large language models such as [BioGPT](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac409). Lightweight projection heads then map all three modalities into a common vector space. CLASP is trained using a tri-modal contrastive loss that simultaneously encourages alignment between matching structure-sequence, structure-description, and sequence-description pairs.
